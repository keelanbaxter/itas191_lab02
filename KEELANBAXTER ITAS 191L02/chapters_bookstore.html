<h1>Chapters Bookstore</h1>
<p>Envelope yourself in knowledge, Starbucks Coffee, and gifts galore with Chapters Bookstore. This is located in North Nanaimo, and serves as one of the most popular bookstores in Nanaimo BC. Come by for a cute bookstore and coffee date all in one, or a quick semi-formal business meeting in the outside patio. Chapters has a lot to offer for gift shopping at Christmas time as well, and is great for birthday gift ideas.
