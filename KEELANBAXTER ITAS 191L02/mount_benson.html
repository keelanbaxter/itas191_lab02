<h1>Mount Benson</h1>
<p>Climb or claw your way to the top of this great mountain located in the heart of Nanaimo. The mountain itself is like a beacon for those seeking a worthy challenge when it comes to cardio, or just want to enjoy a fantastic view of the entirety of Nanaimo's coastline. From the top, you can clearly see Nanoose Bay, Nanaimo, and Vancouver. Reaching the top itself is a fantastic feeling, and taking a selfie in front of the Canadian flag posted on top of the mountain is a tribute to your time spent in Nanaimo.
