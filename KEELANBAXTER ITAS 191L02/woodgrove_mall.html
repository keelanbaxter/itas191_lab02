    <h1>Woodgrove Mall</h1>
<p>Enter into a peaceful feeling mall. One that reminds of a temple for its ambient natural lighting, decorations, and warm atmosphere. Equipped with a foodcourt, many of the most popular retail stores, and more - including a Wal-Mart attachment. This is the place to be for Christmas time. Come see Santa and his elves, or the local carnival when it comes to town. Nanaimo mall serves as a hub for many things, even as a meeting location. As it is home to the main bus stop.  </p>
